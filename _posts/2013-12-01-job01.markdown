IT Consultant at [Blue Mountains Grammar School](http://www.bmgs.nsw.edu.au/) where I conducted a multi campus site wide hardware survey, reconfigured all network devices and produced a written report to highlight potential problem areas with the schools IT infrastructure. I also assisted with the deployment of the schools "Bring Your Own Technology" plan and interacted with students and parents on a daily basis to troubleshoot and enable understanding of the project.
