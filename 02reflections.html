## Reflection

During a patient drop off at the hospital a woman came in and stated that her husband was having difficulty breathing and he was in the car outside. Myself, a paramedic and a nurse went out to the car to assist him. As we arrived at the car the patient had stopped breathing and a resuscitation team was called for. I was instructed by the nurse to commence CPR. As I knelt down beside the patient the paramedic threw me his keys and asked me to get the oxygen kit from the ambulance and he commenced CPR instead. I retrieved the oxygen and the man was taken into resuscitation. I was numb to the situation. I wasn't thinking or feeling so much as reacting and trying to remember my training as I knelt down beside the patient. Overall the experience was a positive one, despite my level of training I was able to help out with getting the man the help he needed and I was proud to finally find out that when faced with a life and death situation I didn't freeze up and I was able to help to the best of my abilities.
