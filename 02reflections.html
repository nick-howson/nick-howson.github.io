## Reflection

We were called to a nursing home where a man was found unresponsive. On arrival there was a nursing assistant giving a man CPR on the floor. The paramedics cut his shirt off and setup the portable electro cardio graph and applied the defibrillator patches to his chest. A breathing tube was inserted and I setup the bag valve mask, oxygen flow and began to provide oxygen to the man. The nursing assistant was asked to check if the man had any resuscitation directives in place. She returned and told us that the man was not for resuscitation. The paperwork was double checked and medical intervention was ceased and the ECG was monitored as heart activity ceased. Medical equipment and rubbish was removed, his eyes closed and covered he was with a sheet. During the incident I felt disconnected and was more focused on getting things correct. Afterwards during the cleanup I found myself wanting to talk to him as I removed equipment from his body. Overall I rate the experience as sad but worthwhile. Going into nursing I knew I would experience death on a regular basis and it is important to understand and cope with it. I do not believe I could have done any anything medically different in this situation. I would have however liked to have done more for the man in death. I would have liked to stay and wash and redress him. Unfortunately I was not there in a nursing capacity and had to leave with the paramedics. The only change I would make is that I would ask for a little more time to provide the body with the proper dignity and integrity that section 9.3 national competency standards require of us <a class="page-scroll" href="#References">(Nursing and Midwifery Board of Australia, 2006)</a>.
