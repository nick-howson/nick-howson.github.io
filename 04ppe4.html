## PPE 4 2016

###Week 2

**Situation:** I was in the simulation room doing a mock resuscitation. Roles where assigned and I was the scribe. 

**Action:** I was trying to watch all the monitors and what everyone else in the resuscitation team was doing. It was confusing because it was the first time for all of us and people were also not sure of what information they needed to give. I did not end up with enough information recorded for it to be a meaningful record. In a real event this would be detrimental to patient outcomes and research has shown that effective communication in a trauma resuscitation leads to better patient outcomes <a class="page-scroll" href="#References">(Clements, Curtis, Horvat, & Shaban, 2015)</a>.

**Outcome:** 
As the scribe it is important that you get all the information you need to fill out the resuscitation record. Next time I should actively ask for the information I do not have as well as encourage others to verbalise what they are doing so the scribe does not need to ask. 

###Week 4

**Situation:** I was priming and preparing a burette to administer dose of ceftriaxone to a patient suffering from COPD after sputum cultures indicated an infection. 

**Action:** I was holding the burette in one hand with the giving set in the other and I dropped the end of the giving set and it touched the ground. In my attempts to stop the end of the giving set touching the ground I also dropped the burette. I picked all of my equipment up and let someone else do their simulation while I sorted out a proper work environment for myself. After sorting out my work environment I attempted the procedure again and was successful in maintaining a sterile environment for the patient.

**Outcome:** The patient received the required medication in a sterile manner to minimise the risk of a hospital acquired infection complicating their stay in hospital. An organised work environment is essential to maintaining a safe and therapeutic environment for patients <a class="page-scroll" href="#References">(Huisman, Morales, van Hoof, & Kort, 2012)</a>.

###Week 10

**Situation:** Today I was preparing an electrolyte solution of potassium to administer to patient with hypokalaemia and administer and ECG.

**Action:** I conducted a ABCDEFG assessment on the patient and noted the need for the infusion due to potassium level being below the normal range. I gathered my equipment, conducted my first patient ID check, validated my order, did the 3 drug checks, did my final patient ID check and hung the bag. I calculated the drip rate and commenced the infusion. Upon commencement of infusion I completed my documentation and handed over to another student. The receiving student noted that I missed some information in my handover. Lack of proper handover regardless of handover method can contribute to treatment errors in the subsequent shifts <a class="page-scroll" href="#References">(Drach-Zahavy & Hadid, 2015)</a>.

**Outcome:** For future practice I will make sure that my handovers are detailed, relevant and easily understood by the receiving party by practicing the ISBAR method of handover to ensure that I practice in a safe and competent manner and stay within the Code of Professional Conduct for Nurses in Australia <a class="page-scroll" href="#References">(NMBA, 2008)</a>.

###Week 11

**Situation:** During my clinical placement I was at the Palliative Care Unit of Mt Druitt Hospital. During my time there I observed many interactions between staff and family members of patients in the process of actively dying. One specific interaction of mine with the family of one patient in particular has stuck with me. The patient had a history of drug abuse and had been diagnosed with cancer and was unable to live alone. We did a bed shuffle to segregate rooms along gender lines and we noted that the patient had become totally unresponsive to voice, touch or by pain just after the move. A nurse left to contact the family and I decided to wait with the patient until the family arrived.

**Action:** The patient’s family arrived with my supervising RN. They asked me about the patient and what had been happening. I informed them that I was a student and I would answer them as best I could. I informed them that the patient hadn’t been left alone and someone had been with them the whole time and that their pain was being managed. I asked the family if they needed anything and they asked for pillows for the patient and one of them laughed and asked if I could get them a beer.  I laughed with them and let them know that the PCU did in fact allow alcohol for both patients and family members and they were welcome to bring some if it would help them. I returned with some extra pillows and some chairs for the family. The patient passed a few hours later.

**Outcome:** I feel that I interacted well with the family of a dying patient, the patient’s needs were taken care of and the patients status was communicated clearly to his immediate family members. Communication is important in a palliative care setting to give best outcomes to all involved as well as providing valuable student learning opportunities <a class="page-scroll" href="#References">(Ballesteros, Centeno, & Arantzamendi, 2014)</a>.
