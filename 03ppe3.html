## PPE 3 2016

My reflection has been written using the tools for self-reflection provided by Gibbs in the work “Learning by doing: a guide to teaching and learning methods” <a class="page-scroll" href="#References">(Gibbs, 1988)</a>.

During my placement in the Cardiac Care Unit of Nepean Hospital I was paired up with an RN working in the single occupancy rooms with the more dependant and at risk patients. A patient had been waiting in his single room for transfer out of the single rooms into the multibed rooms as he was deemed no longer a higher dependency patient. The patient requested supervision while walking to the toilet. After the patient had gone to the toilet the RN and myself assisted with standing them behind their walker. The patient informed us that they would like to walk behind the walker and the RN and I encouraged them to do so. The patient got halfway back to the bed and asked if they could sit on the walker. The RN and I seated the patient on the walker. Upon sitting down the patient became unresponsive and started to slip out of the walker. The RN attempted to rouse the patient while I pressed the emergency button. The patient had stopped breathing and had a weak and erratic pulse. The RN started to get equipment together to get oxygen and I commenced CPR on the patient while the other nursing staff arrived with the emergency trolley. After 25 minutes of attempted resuscitation the lead ICU doctor asked if anyone had any objections to ceasing resuscitation efforts, no one objected and then the doctor called a stop on the call.

My feelings after the incident were conflicted, I felt partially at fault for the death of the patient after encouraging them to walk, worried that my skills perhaps had contributed to the unsuccessful resuscitation attempt and that perhaps we hadn’t tried for long enough. I also felt a bit useless not knowing about all the equipment we used during the resuscitation. After everything had settled down I went and got a drink from the staff kitchen and found that my hands were shaking. One of the ICU doctors had also come into the kitchen and struck up a conversation with me about the MET call. He reassured me that my skills had been sufficient and that I was not at fault for encouraging the patient to walk.

After the MET call and talk with staff I felt a lot better about the situation. I also asked the team leader that night if they would mind going through the whole emergency trolley with me so we could restock it and I could learn more about the equipment. Looking back on the situation I now believe that my presence as a student being there to perform CPR almost immediately from the commencement of the MET call provided the best possible chance of survival for the patient as well as freeing up an RN to do tasks that I was not able to do such as getting medications, IV access, scribing and attending to other patients on the ward.

The following day I did some research and found recent that research shows that a small amount of people receiving CPR in hospital survive to discharge and even less are discharged home and capable of being independent <a class="page-scroll" href="#References">(Gershengorn, Li, Kramer, & Wunsch, 2012)</a>. I also looked at survival rates versus time statistics for CPR and noted that after 25 minutes the survival rate drops off quite significantly <a class="page-scroll" href="#References">(Goldberger et al., 2012)</a>. I also had a look into the effects on patient death with nursing staff and found that my reaction is common even amongst highly experienced nurses <a class="page-scroll" href="#References">(Wilson & Kirshbaum, 2011)</a>.

I do not believe that I could have done anything differently during the incident given my current skill set and exposure to emergency nursing situations. However faced with a similar situation now I believe I would be able to help more than I was able to in this incident. I need to learn more about the contents of the emergency trolley and more about the process and requirements of a MET call within the NSW Health system with regards to scribing, timing of medication administration and processes such as airway management.

To further my clinical skills I need to learn more about the contents of the emergency trolley and learn about the correct airway management. I also need to ensure that I am well versed in the NSW Health policy on deteriorating patients to ensure that the appropriate response is used when working with a deteriorating patient <a class="page-scroll" href="#References">(NSW Health, 2013)</a>.
