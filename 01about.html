## Profile

<!---Profile (“snapshot” of the student: personal attributes; academic and employment
achievements; brief career; strategies to achieve compliance with NMBA guidelines).-->

My name is Nick Howson and I am currently working toward getting a Bachelor of Nursing from Western Sydney University with an aim to graduate in 2018 with a combined degree Bachelor of Applied Leadership and Critical Thinking (BALCT). 

Previously I worked as a Networks and System Engineer with the NSW Department of Education & Communities providing computer support to both teachers and students, providing personal development to staff as well as administrating and running the schools IT infrastructure on a day to day basis. After working with the NSW DEC I began work as a contract IT Consultant and worked with a number of small business and provided home based IT services to people in Western Sydney. I was contracted to Blue Mountains Grammar School for a year where I was asked to conduct what would end up being a year long, multiple campus, site wide hardware survey which culminated in a written report to highlight potential problem areas within the schools IT infrastructure.

I am also volunteer with the [NSW RFS](http://www.rfs.nsw.gov.au/) and enjoy giving back to my community. After being with the RFS and talking to some members I decided that I wanted to work more within an emergency service context and I began to consider nursing as a worthwhile role and decided to go to university as a mature age student to attain my Bachelor of Nursing and become a Registered Nurse. My community experiences with the RFS have contributed to a sense of respect and kindness that I feel is also reflected in the Code of Ethics for Nurses <a class="page-scroll" href="#References">(Nursing and Midwifery Board of Australia, 2006)</a>.
